A scientific tool doctors can use to match patients to their ideal treatment

Currently runs as a .NET Core 3.1 console app, will later be expanded to a web app. Initially designed for doctors deciding with drug to give a patient with lung cancer. Asks 10 questions, so 10 responses from the doctor. Matches the patient with the ideal drug, based on information the doctor gave in the 10 questions about the patient.

The 4 treatment options are:
-Afatinib
-Gefetinib
-Osimertinib
-Erlotinib

These are the 4 drugs offered by the NHS to treat non small cell lung cancer

**All data I used in the code comes from clinical trials data**
